The aurora is beautiful from up here, but it's also a sign that we need to be extra careful with our navigation systems.",

We have special shielding and monitoring systems to protect us. The aurora looks amazing from the International Space Station - it's like watching Earth's magnetic field dance with the solar wind!",

We monitor space weather forecasts 24/7 and can take protective measures like reducing power flow or switching to backup systems. It's like preparing for a cosmic storm!",
